One example of a complicated problem that can be solved using assembly language is matrix multiplication. Here's an example of how to implement matrix multiplication in x86 assembly language using the NASM assembler.
In this code, we first define three matrices A, B, and C in the .data section of the code. We also define the size of the matrices N using an equate directive.

In the .text section of the code, we define the entry point of the program as _start. We first load the addresses of A, B, and C into the registers esi, edi, and edx, respectively. We then use nested loops to compute the matrix multiplication C = A*B.

In the outer loop, we use the push instruction to save the outer loop counter i on the stack. We then use the mov instruction to load the size of the matrices N into the register ecx. In the inner loop, we use the push instruction to save the inner loop counter k on the stack. We then use the mov instruction to load the elements A[i][k] and B[k][j] into the registers eax and ebx, respectively. We use the imul instruction to compute the product A[i][k] * B[k][j], and we use the add instruction to accumulate the result in the corresponding element C[i][j]. We then use the `
